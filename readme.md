# Advent Of Code 2018
This is my repo for the [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018).

## Spoilers
Don't read my code if you don't want spoilers, I describe the probelms and implement solutions in the repository.

## Compilation
I'm using `Apple LLVM version 9.1.0 (clang-902.0.39.2)` since that's what I already had installed on my macbook, but in general my code should just work on any C++ compiler with C++11.

I simply type `c++ -std=c++11 main.cpp` inside the folder for the day and run `./a.out`.
